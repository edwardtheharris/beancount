Beancount Mailing-list: Questions and discussions specific to Beancount occur there. Of related interest is also the Ledger-CLI Forum which contains lots of more general discussions and acts as a meta-list for command-line accounting topics.
Beancount History and Credits: A description of the development history of Beancount and a shout out to its contributors.
A Comparison of Beancount and Ledger &amp; HLedger: A qualitative feature comparison between CLI accounting systems.
Fetching Prices in Beancount: How to fetch and maintain a price database for your assets using Beancount’s tools.
Importing External Data: A description of the process of importing data from external files that can be downloaded from financial institutions and the tools and libraries that Beancount provides to automate some of this.
Cookbook &amp; Examples</p>
<p>These documents are examples of using the double-entry method to carry out specific tasks. Use these documents to develop an intuition for how to structure your accounts.
Command-line Accounting Cookbook: Various examples of how to book many different kinds of financial transactions. This is undoubtedly the best way to build an intuition for how to best use the double-entry method.
Trading with Beancount: An explanation of trading P/L and worked examples of how to deal with various investing and trading scenarios with Beancount. This is a complement to the cookbook.

<h2>Enhancement Proposals &amp; Discussions<a class="headerlink" href="#enhancement-proposals-discussions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I occasionally write proposals for enhancements in order to organize and summarize my thoughts before moving forward, and solicit feedback from other users. This is good material to find out what features I’m planning to add, how things work in detail, or compare the differences with other similar software such as Ledger or HLedger.
A Proposal for an Improvement on Inventory Booking: A proposal in which I outline the current state of affairs in Ledger and Beancount regarding inventory booking, and a better method for doing it that will support average cost booking and calculating capital gains without commissions.
Settlement Dates in Beancount: A discussion of how settlement or auxiliary dates could be used in Beancount, and how they are used in Ledger.
Balance Assertions in Beancount: A summary of the different semantics for making balance assertions in Beancount and Ledger and a proposal to extend Beancount’s syntax to support more complex assertions.
Fund Accounting with Beancount: A discussion of fund accounting and how best to go about using Beancount to track multiple funds in a single ledger.

<h2>About this Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#about-this-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that I’m using Google Docs. I realize that this is unusual for an open source project. If you take offense to this, so you know, I do like text formats too: in graduate school I used LaTeX extensively, and for the last decade I was in love with the reStructuredText format, I even wrote Emacs’ support for it. But something happened around 2013: Google Docs became good enough to write solid technical documentation and I’ve begun enjoying its revision and commenting  facilities extensively: I am hooked, I love it. For users to be able to suggest a correction or place a comment in context is an incredibly useful feature that helps improve the quality of my writing a lot more than patches or comments on a mailing-list. It also gives users a chance to point out passages that need improvement. I have already received orders of magnitude more feedback on documentation than on any of my other projects; it works.
It also looks really good, and this is helping motivate me to write more and better. I think maybe I’m falling in love again with WYSIWYG… Don’t take me wrong: LaTeX and no-markup formats are great, but the world is changing and it is more important to me to have community collaboration and a living document than a crufty TeX file slowly aging in my repository. My aim is to produce quality text that is easy to read, that prints nicely, and most especially these days, that can render well on a mobile device or a tablet so you can read it anywhere. I’m also able to edit it while I’m on the go, which is fun for jotting down ideas or making corrections. Finally, Google Docs has an API that provides access to the doc, so should it be needed, I could eventually download the meta-data and convert it all to another format. I don’t like everything about it, but what it offers, I really do like.
If you want to leave comments, I’d appreciate if you can log into your Google account while you read, so that your name appears next to your comment. Thank you!
